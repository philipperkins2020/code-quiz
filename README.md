# Code-Quiz

## Description 

In this assignment I created a Code Quiz that presents the user with 5 questions to answer. They must complete the quiz in 1 minute and their score is tallied at the end of the quiz and presented with a list of previous highscores. If the user gets a question wrong 10 seconds are deducted from the timer. Also the high scores are logged into local storage using JSON and parsing them together.
